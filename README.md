## **üèóÔ∏è Project Overview**

Describe:
Our project is part of a Kaggle competition connected to the Break Through Tech AI Program, which focuses on advancing diversity and inclusion in artificial intelligence. This competition challenges participants to develop equitable AI solutions that address real-world biases in machine learning.

The Objective of the Challenge:
The goal of this challenge is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify skin conditions across diverse skin tones. By ensuring that the model performs well across different skin types, we aim to create a more inclusive AI system that does not disproportionately favor lighter skin tones, a common issue in existing dermatology AI models.

Real-World Significance and Impact:
Skin condition detection plays a critical role in healthcare, influencing early diagnosis and treatment outcomes. However, AI models in dermatology often lack diverse training data, leading to biased predictions that fail to serve underrepresented populations. By participating in this challenge, we contribute to advancing equity in AI by developing a model that centers on those historically excluded in medical AI applications. Our work has the potential to improve access to accurate dermatological assessments for all individuals, regardless of their skin tone.

## **üìä Data Exploration**

**Describe:**

* The dataset is a subset of the FitzPatrick17k dataset, a labeled collection of about 17,000 images depicting a variety of serious (e.g., melanoma) and cosmetic (e.g., acne) dermatological conditions with a range of skin tones scored on the FitzPatrick skin tone scale (FST). About 4500 images are in this set, representing 21 skin conditions out of the 100+ in the full FitzPatrick set.

* The data exploration and preprocessing involved loading the dataset from CSV files, creating full file paths for images by combining the label and md5hash columns, and encoding the categorical label column into numerical values using LabelEncoder(). Additionally, the dataset was split into 80% for training and 20% for validation. These steps helped prepare the data for use in training a machine learning model while ensuring compatibility and efficiency in the process.

**Potential visualizations to include:**

* Plots, charts, heatmaps, feature visualizations, sample dataset images
