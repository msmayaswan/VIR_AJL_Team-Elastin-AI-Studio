## **üèóÔ∏è Project Overview**

Describe:
Our project is part of a Kaggle competition connected to the Break Through Tech AI Program, which focuses on advancing diversity and inclusion in artificial intelligence. This competition challenges participants to develop equitable AI solutions that address real-world biases in machine learning.

The Objective of the Challenge:
The goal of this challenge is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify skin conditions across diverse skin tones. By ensuring that the model performs well across different skin types, we aim to create a more inclusive AI system that does not disproportionately favor lighter skin tones, a common issue in existing dermatology AI models.

Real-World Significance and Impact:
Skin condition detection plays a critical role in healthcare, influencing early diagnosis and treatment outcomes. However, AI models in dermatology often lack diverse training data, leading to biased predictions that fail to serve underrepresented populations. By participating in this challenge, we contribute to advancing equity in AI by developing a model that centers on those historically excluded in medical AI applications. Our work has the potential to improve access to accurate dermatological assessments for all individuals, regardless of their skin tone.

## **üìä Data Exploration**

**Describe:**

* The dataset is a subset of the FitzPatrick17k dataset, a labeled collection of about 17,000 images depicting a variety of serious (e.g., melanoma) and cosmetic (e.g., acne) dermatological conditions with a range of skin tones scored on the FitzPatrick skin tone scale (FST). About 4500 images are in this set, representing 21 skin conditions out of the 100+ in the full FitzPatrick set.

* The data exploration and preprocessing involved loading the dataset from CSV files, creating full file paths for images by combining the label and md5hash columns, and encoding the categorical label column into numerical values using LabelEncoder(). Additionally, the dataset was split into 80% for training and 20% for validation. These steps helped prepare the data for use in training a machine learning model while ensuring compatibility and efficiency in the process.

### ‚öñÔ∏è Label Distribution in Training Data: Skin Condition Sample Count
*Displays the number of training images per skin condition (x-axis: image count, y-axis: conditions sorted by frequency).*

<img src="EDA_Visualizations/labels1.png" alt="EDA Visualization" width="600">

**Insights**: 
* **Class Imbalance:** Dominant classes (e.g., squamous-cell-carcinoma) vastly outnumber rarer ones (e.g., basal-cell-carcinoma-morpheaform).
* **Model Impact:** An imbalanced dataset may bias the model toward well-represented classes, reducing accuracy for underrepresented labels.
* **Healthcare Implications:** Underrepresentation could lead to misdiagnoses in real-world scenarios if not properly addressed.

### ‚öñÔ∏è Three Partition Distribution
*Displays how many images exist per Fitzpatrick skin tone (x-axis) and diagnosis label (color/hue).*

<img src="EDA_Visualizations/partition.png" alt="EDA Visualization" width="600">

**Insights**: 
* There are far more images for lighter skin tones (e.g., scale 2 or 3) than darker tones (e.g., scale 5 or 6). This imbalance can cause the model to perform better on lighter tones and poorly on darker ones, potentially perpetuating healthcare disparities.
* Addressing underrepresentation is crucial for fairness and reducing misdiagnosis in darker skin tones; this can be achieved through targeted data augmentation, balanced sampling, and model adjustments like class weighting and fine-tuning.

### ‚öñÔ∏è Fitzpatrick Scale Distribution
*Compares the counts of images grouped into three overarching diagnostic categories‚Äîmalignant, non-neoplastic, and benign.* 

<img src="EDA_Visualizations/fitzpatrick.png" alt="EDA Visualization" width="600">

**Insights:**
* **Imbalance in Samples:** Malignant conditions dominate, followed by non-neoplastic, with benign conditions being the least represented.
* **Model Bias:** A model may learn to better detect malignant features, reducing accuracy for benign and non-neoplastic conditions.
* **Clinical Implications:** Misclassification can lead to unnecessary treatments or missed diagnoses, impacting patient care.
* **Mitigation Strategies:** Use data augmentation, class weighting, or collect more benign samples to balance the dataset and improve model performance.
